For group bookings, rooms are more likely to be allocated according to the number of participants: groups of two will receive double occupancy rooms (with couples receiving first preference), groups of three will be placed in triple occupancy rooms, and groups of four in quadruple occupancy rooms.

Please consider your group size carefully, as changes to room assignments may not be possible once allocated.

For individual bookings, room sharing will be arranged based onÂ availability."
